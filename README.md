# Ludus

Ludus, a survival roguelike game and also a game engine built on pixijs

On the gameplay side Ludus will be a roguelike game inspired by Cataclysm DDA but in javascript for the moment more limited but with more modern interface and more comfortable controls.

The base of Ludus is the modularity so the separation of the game and the game engine is important.
